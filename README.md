## Recent Projects

- [Employee Invoicing Platform](https://employee-invoice.vercel.app/)
  - As a part of our final year project, me and a colleague created
  an employee invoicing platform which automates the creating
  of invoices for an organization and sends the invoice to the
  customer via mail. The software keeps a track of the stock
  and sends an alert to the supplier when stock is low and keeps
  track of the growth of the customers, sales, etc. and gives an
  analytical graph to the organization.

- [College Festival Webpage](https://www.festmosaic.in/)
  - I worked with a team of 3 people to create the college's
  annual festival's (Mosaic) website, wherein I assisted in designing the
  frontend, creating the pages and functionality of the site.
  The site features the different events and the pictures of the
  events on the days of the festival.
